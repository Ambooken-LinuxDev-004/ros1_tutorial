catkin init -> to initialize workspace
catkin build -> to build workspace

rostopic list -> displays the topic

rostopic echo /<topicname>


*****
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash -> sourcing ros enviroment
source ~/ros1_tutorial/ros1_tutorial/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash -> sourcing <workspace> in ros enviroment
******

rospack list -> it lists all packages that are located in my package
rospack list | grep <packagename> -> shows the path of the package

catkin clean --orphans -> removes package traces from devel, build & other folders from workspace permanently(note:- it should be deleted from src folder berfore executing this command)

ROS topics -> used for communicate with robot. Robot will keep listening to the last message that you published in topic. publisher is a ROS program that writes a msg into a topic[e.g. /cmd_vel topic (used to send velocity commands)]

Services -> allows you to code a specific functionality for your robot and provide anyone to call it.

Service server -> provides functionality to anyone who wants to use it(call it)
